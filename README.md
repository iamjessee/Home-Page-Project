# NEXT - Homepage Project

Welcome to the repository for the **NEXT** homepage project, a simple yet effective demonstration of my growing web development skills. This project is designed to showcase my understanding of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while I continue to enhance my primary expertise in C#.

## Project Overview

**NEXT** s a conceptual next-generation technology company. This homepage was created to demonstrate my current understanding of basic web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While this specific project will remain a static example, it marks an important step in my journey toward integrating these front-end skills with C# in future projects.

My goal is to continue building more complex and dynamic web applications that leverage both web development and C# programming skills. This project represents a foundational exercise in that ongoing learning process.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and content of the homepage.
- **CSS**: Adds styling and layout, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements interactive features and enhances the user experience.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the content of the homepage.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that contains styles for layout, typography, and responsiveness.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the homepage.

## Goals and Future Plans

- **C# Integration**: As I advance in my C# learning journey, I plan to integrate backend services into this project, turning this static homepage into a fully functional web application.
- **ASP.NET Development**: Eventually, I will rebuild this project using ASP.NET to combine my front-end skills with a powerful backend framework.
- **Continuous Learning**: This project is a work in progress, reflecting my ongoing learning and development in both web and software engineering.
